# :rocket: Overview: frontend
An user interface so that user ask questions, register their skills and perform skill training.

This project is build with the [Vue Framework](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html).
Styling is done with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/).

**Note:** During development make sure to use the same version of npm as for the Docker container. Check the Dockerfile for the currently used version.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Project structure
The project structure was mostly autogenerated with VueCLI and should be familar to anyone who has worked with Vue before.

* public: the website before Vue injection  
* src: the Vue project  
    * App.vue, main.js: Entry points  
    * api: API calls to the backend server or to skills  
    * router, store: Vue router and Vuex store  
    * views: Main Vue components that serve as pages  
    * components: Vue components used in views or other components
* .env* : Environment variables, where the *backend server API endpoints* is defined


## :computer:  Detailed description of the source directory
### src/api /index.js 

A central location that contains all of the API requests that call the API server from square backend. The API calls are done with Axios, a built-in HTTP client module. All API requests should be registered here and thus be imported from this file to reduce boilerplates in code, in general writing the request directly in the view page should be avoid.

### src/components  

contains all of the reusable template components that can be rendered in different pages (e.g navigation bar), these components can be imported into your view as needed

### src/components/results

contains reusable templates to render different type of query results or also called answers, not all answers are in the form of a short plain passage of text. The template creates a slot for an answer.

### src/router/index.js

A central location where all of the routing between URLs to a page (also called view or component) are defined. When a new page is created, a path to this page must be registered here.


### src/store/index.js
A central file to defined all of the states that are used in the app, which can latter be used in the views. This file implemented the store concept in Vuejs, different components shared a state, and there are certain actions bind to a state change. When a state changed, the store raises events to fire the predefined actions. 

### src/views/…
This directory stores all of the different views /HTML pages for the app

### :memo: Routing Guidelines

### :computer: How to Deploy the Frontend on your Local 

If you want to deploy only the frontend locally, you can do this:

1. Clone https://github.com/UKP-SQuARE/square-core/
2. cd frontend
3. npm install
4. npm run serve

Now, you should be able to run the frontend of square on your local. The backend will still be working because it will access square.ukp-lab.de to perform all the API calls. The file .env.development tells the UI where is the backend, so you can change the values of those environment variables to localhost if you are deploying the full SQuARE on your local.
